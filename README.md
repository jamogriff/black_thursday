## Black Thursday

Reportedly the hardest project from Mod 1 at Turing, Black Thursday serves as an intensive course in class design, inheritance, and creating and processing large amounts of data. An Etsy-like database of merchant, items, invoices and transactions was parsed from csv files to create corresponding Ruby objects. These ten's of thousands of objects were then analyized using custom methods to provide insights to our team as well as to our merchants using the platform.
