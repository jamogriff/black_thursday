## DTR: Define the Relationship


### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
* Ensuring everybody understands all the working componenets. (This relates to a depth of understanding of the code for both teaching partners and learning partners.) 
* Everybody should be able to explain key methods and the data interactions. 

What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
* Each group member should own certain parts of the project. Divide and conquer may be imperative for this project. 
* Would like for the group to check in at least once a day as the whole group. 
* Presentations to the group when important functionality as been created so we are all on one page.
* Check ins are also good space to get input from others on difficulties/stuck points.
* Working together more at the beginning can be helpful to learn where partners are at in terms of skills and background.
* We are committing to a slower-paced project that is more in-depth and learning-focused versus grade-oriented.

How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
* Direct and timely communication (for Matt), 
* Direct communication can be antidote to imposter syndrome/weak link concerns (Alex), 
* Open and honest communication with direct feedback which assumes positive intent (Leigh), 
* Balance between context with examples and being direct (Aliya), 
* Coming from a teaching background and sometimes over-teaching, prefer zoom/in-person to Slack (Jamison)

How would you describe your work style?
* Organized, sequential, planned, and detail-oriented; harder to skip steps or jump in the middle of something (Leigh, Aliya, Matt)
* Intuition (Jamison)
* "ADHD/Shotgun" method, covers a lot of ground, can help others move on (Alex)

What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
* Alex is not invested in any particular point; willing to change gears. Open to trying multiple things, creative, fosters growth.
* Focus and commitment for Matt

What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
* Well: pom breaks, check-ins, 
* Poorly: when people are excessively independent from team and instructors,

How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
* This DTR a good start
* Daily stand-ups and stand-downs to assure mission-alignment of tasks and focus.

How will we overcome obstacles?
* Scheduling, stress, volume of material, and novel topics
* Soft-side challenges: bring up in stand-up and stand-down. 
* Technical challanges: create a framework: 1. Team/Slack (use team resources), 2. Ask peers, 3. Ask outside resources/mentors, etc., 4. Instructors (but let's use this full continuum!)
* The answer to the question, "should I bring this up?" is YES. We have already discussed members' being open to feedback.

What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
* Leigh likes music in the background (let her know if it's too loud). 
* Matt likes a schedule and specific goals. 
* Jamison needs the room to finish a task.
* Alex can get stressed when she or the group is off-topic.
* Aliya needs quiet/silence with no distractions. May need to separate self from group.

What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
* Matt generally available outside of check-ins with instructors.
* Alex not available on Saturday, or Tue night. Dog requires attention periodically (~30min).
* Aliya 4-5 Wed, hope for Friday chill. Prefer 8a-8p for work times. Sunday off (but flexible).
* Leigh has several requirements; see Slack. Prefer finish 10p Mountain.

What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
* As above. 

What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
* Jamison has done data parsion with .csv, built web apps, git version control. Wants to focus on mocks and stubs.
* Alex has done similar project before. Wants to learn more about how classes interact.
* Aliya has experience (remote) with data analysis, comfortable with .csv and parsing data in other languages. Wants to focus on mocks and stubs.
* Matt feels like he does not have a technical strength to contribute, would like to get more comfortable with methods.
* Leigh has done a similar project, but getting into a part of mod where she struggled before. Comfortable with TDD/OOP, want to learn more about data analysis and parsing.

What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
* Leigh paid for Zoom (Sweet!) and can make rooms. (Try whiteboard feature)
* PM using Github. (Tickets linked to PR and commits)
* Lucid Chart (help visualize)

How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
* As above.

How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
* Everybody can explain how it works.

How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
* "Win of the Day" as part of stand-down.
* PR comments

### Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine

What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)
* Would prefer to see people on camera.

When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could affect your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those moments?
* Alex may need to take care of dog, will talk to neighbor about coming over.

If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype.
* NOPE

Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?
* 40min/5min.

Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?
* Morning greetings on Slack, prior to stand-up. 

Project: *Black Thursday*
